PLEASE CHECK **MASTER** BRANCH FOR ALL THE FILES AND COMMITS


## Problem Statement
After the worldwide pandemic, the labor market in India has been suffered from some imperfections such as lack of adequate information regarding jobs, lack of suitable agency for the proper utilization of labor force, lack of proper manpower planning etc. In this tough time, when each person’s life has been drastically changed, labors are also not getting the correct amount of monetary support that they need and hence the national economy is also being affected. 
It is tough for one to find a job in nearby area due to certain factors like migration, skill mismatch, lack of proper knowledge about the channels that matches employee and employer. In the age of Digital era, you may still find that there are various labor chowks and people come here in the morning and get hired by various construction contractors on a daily basis for the construction activities. The problem is both ways round, when asked to the employer, they said that there are limited platforms to find a daily worker and that too are very costly, for the workers, solutions like Urban clap etc are still beyond their knowledge domain.



## Solution
Thinking a solution to all these problems and taking a step forward for a better tomorrow, TEAM CATTTYWAMPUS has digitalized labor chowk where the user and the labour can come in contact directly with one another. 
SHRAMIK is a cheaper and easily accessible platform for skill matching. By creating this app we’re giving employers an easy-to-use platform so that he can hire workers/ labours just in few easy steps.
We are providing a platform where the labour can register free of cost and doesn’t have to pay like he/she does to a contractor. The user, on the other hand, has to login/signup and gets to contact the labour nearest in the locality according to the need. All the workers will be rated and reviewed by user on the basis of the quality of work.

After a certain period of time and success of the project, we will also conduct bootcamps and workshops targeting the unskilled labour and improve their skills and knowledge.

Benefits:
1.	The customer/user can directly hire labours for small or big jobs, whatsoever.
2.	The daily wage labour will get his payment on the spot after the work.
3.	Labour doesn’t have to pay any registration fees.
4.	Elimination of Middle Man
5.	Educating the workers 
6.	Hassle free Labour Hiring 
7.	User Friendly 
8.	Cross Platform based application/web services
